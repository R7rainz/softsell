The layout follows a minimalist approach, allowing users to focus on the key aspects of the platform: browsing software licenses, interacting with the chat widget, and navigating the smooth-scrolling interface.

The animations and design is inspired by my previous project, [CodeQuest Lite](https://codequest-lite.vercel.app), but adjusted to meet the more professional needs of SoftSell. The goal was to create a clean, user-friendly interface that is both visually appealing and functional.

Key design elements include:
